    <h2>Mouthpiece</h2>
<p>Another huge project I undertook would be another Corporate Clash Manager boss, this one called
    The Mouthpiece. While I didn't contribute too much to the original design at release, I helped contribute greatly to the overhaul of the fight that released with the Summer Update,
    or Version 1.4. We realized after release of 1.3 that the fight for the Mouthpiece was extremely lackluster, and the fight needed a huge overhaul. We ended up pursuing my idea
    to revamp the fight, giving players a brand new remastered experience to enjoy.</p>
