<h1>A Collection of Game Design Work</h1>
<p>I currently work on a live-service MMO of a fan revival of Disney's Toontown Online called Toontown: Corporate Clash. I currently serve as one of two Game Design Directors for the game.
    Here is a collection of some of the bigger things I've worked on for the game, contributing countless hours to designs, balancing, and testing before they hit the live servers.</p>

<h2>The Gumball Machine</h2>
<p>One of Corporate Clash's newly beloved features that got introduced with update v1.3 was the Gumball Machine, which allowed players to exchange a new currency called Gumballs
    earned from fighting bosses and doing activities around the game for rare and unique cosmetic items. The machine houses numerous prizes from boosters to aide gameplay,
    cosmetic clothing that's newer and from years past, profile poses and backgrounds, and tons of accessories to choose from. The concept of the machine was designed entirely by myself,
    but originally it was a stand with one of our characters, Lynn Decisive. Over time, the idea evolved into a sentient gumball machine that would be positioned inside of our
    in-game quest hubs.</p>

<h2>The Chainsaw Consultant</h2>
<p>One of Corporate Clash's new Manager boss Cogs that arrived with v1.3, and probably one of the most infamous ones, known for being extremely tricky and difficult to figure out.
    The Chainsaw Consultant's battle includes several puzzle elements tied in with a R.E.V. system (like chainsaw revving!) that the player must control and keep an eye on.
    With enough knowledge, the player can learn how to manipulate the battle the way they want it to go. But with enough reckless play, it's easy to fall to this boss fight.
    This fight took about eight hours total over the session of one very long meeting to design, and countless hours in testing to ensure all scenarios played out the way we wanted them to.

<h2>Mouthpiece</h2>
<p>One last big project I worked on that I'll show (I've done a lot more, but I don't want to flood the page too hard), would be another Corporate Clash Manager boss, this one called
    The Mouthpiece. While I didn't contribute too much to the original design at release, I helped contribute greatly to the overhaul of the fight that released with the Summer Update,
    or Version 1.4. We realized after release of 1.3 that the fight for the Mouthpiece was extremely lackluster, and the fight needed a huge overhaul. We ended up pursuing my idea
    to revamp the fight, giving players a brand new remastered experience to enjoy.</p>

<h2>Constantly Working</h2>
<p>I'm constantly working on other projects, due to being on the Game Design Team (and management) for Corporate Clash. We're currently deep in the Hammerspace update, which aims
    to completely change how the game handles inventory and optimizes it heavily. I can't share many details from that, but I've been working countless hours on that, and a secret
    update that's coming after.<br>
    I'm also applying skills I'm learning in my other classes to start working on some games, as well as participating in some Game Jams around Florida and online with friends.</p>
