<h1>Our Services</h1>
<p>We offer a variety of services here at our vet clinic before your furry friend makes its' way home to you.</p>
<h2>Neutering/Spaying</h2>
<p>Our trained Vets can take care of your spay and neuter needs as soon as you adopt your animal! Every animal adopted with us is required to get fixed before they're brought home.
    This should be included in the adoption fees!</p>
<h2>Shots and Routine Checkups</h2>
<p>Should you decide to stick with us instead of another animal hospital, we can also do routine checkups for your pets, and ensure they are up to date on their shots. Vet appointments start at
    $30.00, with additional charges being determined based on services. For more information, please call our front desk and ask for the Vet office!</p>
<h2>Looking To Do Charity Work?</h2>
<p>Here at Aiden's, we have plenty of trained professionals helping us run the place. However, we always love to see our community coming out to help us!
    If you'd like to apply to do some work for charity, please contact our front desk via in person or over the phone for more details.</p>
