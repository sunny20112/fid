<h2>Adoption How-To</h2>
<p>If you'd like to adopt, you can come to our location at 675 Imaginary Way in Orlando, FL. We only offer in-person adoptions.</p>
    <p>We do not require any minimum income or extensive background checks to adopt. We believe everyone is entitled to an animal, no matter their circumstances.</p>
<h2>Adoption Holds</h1>
    <p>If you see an animal online you'd like to take a look at, give us a call and we'll go ahead and place a 24 hour hold on the animal, provided you can come the same day to see it.
        If you cannot come same day, we cannot place a hold on an animal. Any animal that is already held can be viewed if you come to our facility, but
        we can only hold one animal for one person at a time. At closing every day, we'll take all current holds off animals.</p>
<h2>Ready to Adopt?</h2>
<p>We're delighted to hear it! Once you're ready to adopt one of our animals, we'll go ahead and start the adoption process with you. You'll need your ID,
    and enough money to handle adoption fees. We'll spay and neuter your new friend before they go home for you, and those fees are included in the adoption fee.</p>
